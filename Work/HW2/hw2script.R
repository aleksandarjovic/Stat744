### Homework 2: Why do we let doctors give our kids vaccines? Aleksandar Jovic. Jan 24, 2018 ###

#theme_set(theme_bw())  #??? we'll see how things look
# Comments justifications will be posted in this document, and the .Rmd


#~Dataset~#

vac=datraw[,2:5]   #filtering out what I don't need

#Some oddities with the data:
#1. Mumps had 0 recorded cases at the inception of the vaccine. Were they just not recording it before the creation of the vaccine? Unlikely. We could impute this by setting the value to some value based on the expected growth from the next 5 years (regression backwards).
#2. Hepatitis' A and B, and Polio have two vaccine inceptions. (Again going with the idea that we're comparing vaccine effectiveness, while not every vaccine is made the same, nor is it for the same disease -- however the overall idea is fine)
#3. Pertussis seems to have a resurgence after the mid-80s (perhaps vaccine was distributed less, perhaps it became less effective).
#4. As stated on the website: "*Chickenpox data were not reported by all states between 1981 and 2003."

vac1= (vac %>%
         filter(vaccine!=FALSE)
) #creates new mini version of data which will let me easily plot specifically the vaccine implementations
# I thought about putting it in the vac as it's own column, but vac2= vac %>% mutate(vacd= ) wasn't sure how to use the vaccine!=FALSE condition there

# Using AREA rather than RADIUS (since radius grows by a squared factor -- misleading)
# Diseases are arranged alphabetically, because why not in this case. Each disease is vastly different, as is its respective vaccine. I'll be getting into this later however for a better comparison.
# Rather than specifying a new column which contains that data, then adding a new layer which recolours that specific point with the orange, is there a way to have the data chosen conditionally? some sort of 'if' statement. Perhaps something like this geom_point(data= x$vaccine!=FALSE ...) ... unsure where to take this.

# Note, I piped vac1 after I wrote the spaghetti version of my replica. I used it to add the layer with the black dots, but couldn't use it to create the blue and orange separately -- see the below commented out code.
# When I tried to add separate layers (to avoid the blue parts getting too overlapped and hard to see, so I could only make the orange part more opaque), I got very weird colours... Like not at all the same???

#~Time series~#
# We are looking at how numbers change with respect to time, while a time series may appear as a banal option to graphics high-society, it is certainly effective. In its simplicity and intuitive presentation, it can clealry deliver the data at a glance.

##Time series with vaccine shown as center

##How effective are vaccines? graphing rate of change (cut off until start of vaccine?) faster decrease is better.
#if we're looking at effectiveness, is the "before" really as important?
#mutate with diff()


#~Discussion~#
#pros and cons of graph. Area gives quick overview really easily, but is it misleading? The overlap of the bubbles can fool the eye.
#The time series often shows downward trends before the vaccine's implementation... One might argue the decrease of the disease due to concentrated effort by physicians to combat disease, and vaccine being implemented during that downhill slope is spurious information.


#?????????????????????????extra credit hypothetical... i.e. creation of chart, and how to use data
