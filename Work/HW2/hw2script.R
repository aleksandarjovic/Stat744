### Homework 2: So why do we let doctors give our kids vaccines? Aleksandar Jovic. Jan 24, 2018 ###

# note, I piped vac1 after I wrote the spaghetti version of my replica. It helped me add the dots
# Using AREA rather than RADIUS (since radius grows by a squared factor -- misleading)
# Diseases are arranged alphabetically, because why not in this case. Each disease is vastly different, as is its respective vaccine. I'll be getting into this later however for a better comparison.
# I tried passing the following argument to pinpoint the vaccine dates and colour them differently data= x$vaccine!=FALSE ... I deleted what I was trying, but it was also a mess.
# Rather than specifying a new column which contains that data, then adding a new layer which recolours that specific point with the orange, is there a way to have the data chosen conditionally? some sort of 'if' statement seems like it could do the trick?

#Note, when I tried to add separate layers (to avoid the blue parts getting too overlapped and hard to see, so I could only make the orange part more opaque), I got very weird colours... Like not at all the same???

##Time series (simple but most natural, no reason to overcomplicate)

##Time series with vaccine shown as center

##How effective are vaccines? graphing rate of change (cut off until start of vaccine?) faster decrease is better.
#if we're looking at effectiveness, is the "before" really as important?
#mutate with diff()


#extra credit hypothetical... i.e. creation of chart, and how to use data
