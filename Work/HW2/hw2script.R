# Using AREA rather than RADIUS (since radius grows by a squared factor -- misleading)


##Time series (simple but most natural, no reason to overcomplicate)

##Time series with vaccine shown as center

##How effective are vaccines? graphing rate of change (cut off until start of vaccine?) faster decrease is better.


#extra credit hypothetical... i.e. creation of chart, and how to use data
