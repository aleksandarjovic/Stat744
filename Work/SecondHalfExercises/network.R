#This was the "homework" in the notes, the application part was a bit confusing
#I couldn't really follow their examples like the other presentations, as the packages weren't identified (for one thing)

#for future reference, here is an excellent link with a lot of really fantastic examples: http://kateto.net/network-visualization
#Here's an example for network of businesses

## JD: Thanks and sorry for inconvenience â˜º

head(as.data.frame(short.stergm.sim))

#simulated data of renaissance florentine family business conections

plot(short.stergm.sim) #this plots network without any time (combines all nodes that were meant to combine)
plot(network.extract(short.stergm.sim, at=5)) #this shows the network at time=5

#this next part uses the d3 from the java presentation
# JD: Again, your script should run start-finish. 
render.d3movie(short.stergm.sim,displaylabels=TRUE)

#pretty neat stuff, check out the link for tons more
# JD: Yes, we will look at this for next year
